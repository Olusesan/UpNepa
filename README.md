A Power Management Application Project for Unite Learning 
This is a collaborative project for Unite Learninng students class of March 2024.  

# About the project

Power supply is very erratic in lots of African countries including Nigeria. Because power companies do not provide any type of meaningful information regarding the variation in the supply of power within different neighborhoods, it is impossible to have any kind of data driven insight into how much power is stable or unstable between different neighborhoods. The goal of this project is to use survey to collect direct information from users across different neighborhoods during different times of the day. The survey participants were grouped into their respoective neighborhoods and asked to report on the status of their power supply three times a day (Morining, Aftrenoon, Night). The data is collected for 14 days (April 25 - March 9) and turned into a pandas dataframe that is assigned to a color coded geofence on a map interface; when a date and time of the day is selected, the color coded geofence displays the power status of the neighborhood (green for power on, red for power off).

# Contributions

We are seeking contributors to add to this project and expend its scope. We need help continous and contemporary data collection better visualization to compare data and update to our interface design. If you want to add this as a school project or if you have any other questions, please reach out to unite_learning@gmail.com
